Utilized real data gathered from cancer patients. Open sourced genomes of anonymous individuals were gathered, specifically those who had a form of pancreatic cancer. In this project, we focused on gathering this data, processing the data utilizing pythons powerful data analytics tools (ie: comparative genomics vvia Biopython), and using this data to classify some genomic markers between cancerous pancreatic genomes and normal pancreatic genomes from the same individaul. We concluded with a rudimentary graphical depiction that would allow researchers to see areas of interest in the genome to allow for more directed research into possible areas of therapeutic target.
